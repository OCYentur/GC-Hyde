There are many layers and traces on our surroundings both subtle and visible,
including human and non-human history hidden in corners, shadows, holes, waste,
objects, landscape and more. Whether we are conscious of them or not, these layers
of life leak both joy and tension into our everyday moments. Anxious yet familiar world
is a group exhibition curated by Gizem Candan featuring a diverse selection of artworks
by Emily Chudnovsky, Sydney Lad, Francis Pitsadiotis, Deepikah RB, Danielle Vincent,
and Chaoran Zhou, whose practices explore a range of concepts and materials, such
as body, ruins, animate and inanimate objects, climate change, memory, emotions,
hope and more. This exhibition offers an environment where pleasure and pressure
coexist and often interplay.
<br>
<br>
The artists examine the hidden state of discomfort in everyday life, juxtaposed with the
comfort found in the familiar through diverse mediums and conceptual frameworks.
This dichotomy is reflected in forms such as the uncanny appearance of Lad's
salvaged wood sculptures and the state of transition in places that depicts both
familiarity and alienation in Vincent's paintings. The works in the exhibition appear both
grotesque and playful. Pitsadiotis illustrates sex as giving and receiving in both literal
and symbolic ways in their painting, i've seen half of god's face here, composting the
merged bodies beneath the layers of the conscious and subconscious mind.
<br>
<br>
Human waste has become omnipresent in today's world, even in the deep waters and
soils that sustain life. Chudnovsky’s recent work captures this conflict by using both
synthetic and organic decay, creating an intersection where the two converge to form
patterns. RB’s immersive installation and painting, Nature Not Mother, form a web of
life's fragments, inviting viewers to move beyond a human-centric perspective. With its
multiple layers, Zhou’s sculpture, Brother, reflects the traces people left in places,
evoking a sense of familiarity.
<br>
<br>
Anxious yet familiar world invites the viewer to embrace the often overlooked feeling of
uneasiness found in everyday moments. The exhibition still aims to maintain the spirit
of hope by encouraging visitors to reconsider how they engage with and find beauty in
the subtle aspects of their daily lives.
