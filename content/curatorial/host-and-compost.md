<i>Host & Compost</i> is a material-based curatorial research and thesis exhibition that presents two Toronto-based artists, Leeay Aikawa and Sara Maston, at Ignite Gallery. The artists employ various artistic mediums, including painting, sculpture, and installation, to create artworks exploring concepts such as compost, decomposition, being host to non-humans, life, death, and rebirth. Through tangible and metaphysical aspects of composting, the exhibition aims to build fresh dialogues between visitors and decomposers. This research investigates life inside compost piles while seeing it as a metaphor for further investigation through art and philosophy.
